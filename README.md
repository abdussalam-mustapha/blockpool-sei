# 🔷 Blockpool: Your AI-Powered DeFi Gateway on SEI

**Blockpool** is your decentralized co-pilot, empowering crypto users with AI-driven DeFi tools, secure smart agents, and a community-first experience — all seamlessly integrated with the SEI EVM network.

---

## 🚀 Platform Overview

Blockpool transforms how everyday users interact with DeFi by introducing intelligent on-chain agents and a conversational AI dashboard that automate, protect, and optimize your crypto actions.

Unlike traditional DeFi dashboards, Blockpool is:
- **Personalized**: Each user has their own analytics and agent interface.
- **Autonomous**: AI-driven recommendations, monitoring, and execution.
- **Real-Time**: Live data from SEI EVM and EVM-compatible addresses.
- **Transparent**: Full ownership and control, with on-chain logs and user-defined permissions.

## 🧠 Core Highlights

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 Personal Smart Agents | Each user gets a dedicated agent contract — private, secure, and owned by your wallet.      |
| ⚙️ Strategy Automation   | Automate rebalancing, staking, risk hedging, or stablecoin shifting based on your goals.    |
| 💬 Conversational UX     | Just chat: “Protect my assets,” “Stake unused tokens,” or “Pause activity.”                 |
| ⚡ SEI Native             | Lightning-fast finality, low latency, and high throughput — optimized for SEI EVM.          |
| 🛡️ Security-First        | You define scope, permissions, and kill switches. Full control, no compromises.             |
| 🤝 Community Engine       | Evolving with collective feedback, strategies, and user-provided vaults.                    |

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Deploy Your Copilot**
   - Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Keplr, etc.)
   - Click “Launch My Agent”
   - Deploys your personal smart agent tied to your wallet
   - Approve access scopes (stake, swap, balance movement)

2. **Pick a Strategy Mode**
   - **Safe Mode**: Focuses on risk minimization, collateral safety.
   - **Yield Boost**: Targets best returns across SEI protocols.
   - **Chill Mode**: Keeps you in stables and earns passively.

3. **Live Monitoring**
   - Agent checks your portfolio 24/7
   - Alerts on risks, unused capital, high-yield shifts
   - Feeds powered by Chainlink, SeiScan, DeFiLlama, and SEI MCP

4. **Automated Execution**
   - Swap/stake/move based on your strategy
   - Repay loans, hedge, or farm — autonomously
   - Logs every action transparently on-chain

5. **AI Chat Control**
   - Speak naturally:  
     - “Switch to Safe Mode.”  
     - “Move idle SEI to top-yield vaults.”  
     - “Pause everything.”
   - Your agent responds with confirmations, insights, and historical logs.
